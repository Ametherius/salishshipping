    testimonial:
      "Working with Gabriel and Salish Shipping has been the most important and helpful change in my small business that I can think of in recent years.  It's more than just him saving the day through Canada Post's recent strikes, it's his customer service, his knowledge, and how convenient his services are.  When the USA tariff situation came into play I was really worried about how my small business would proceed but Gabriel had it all figured out quickly, he knew exactly what to do and we haven't had a single problem since.  The courier shipping services are fast and super reliable and a great price too, and they even pick up the packages.  I hope to get to work with Gabriel for many years and I really appreciate him.",

    testimonial: `Before I started using Salish Shipping co, rising postage costs were killing me and my small business. I was taking a personal hit on every sale that needed to be shipped because I just couldn’t fathom charging my customers what it actually cost to ship their item. 
    <br><br>Gabriel and Salish Shipping has been a game changer. I save a significant amount, no longer pay anything out of pocket AND my items are picked up right from my studio. No more trips to the post office. 
    <br><br>Gabriel is so awesome. The communication is wonderful and very prompt.
    <br><br>Couldn’t be happier and am so glad I found Salish Shipping co!`,

    testimonial: `Salish Shipping has upped my shipping game. For years I was wishing there was a delivery service with easy communication, because shipping valuable artwork can be nerve-wracking. Salish Shipping gives me peace of mind to know there is someone I can reach out to directly as I can get a quote and stay in touch via text… The prices are good as well, always lower than Canada Post with the bonus of pickup right from my studio. Recommend!`,

    testimonial:
      "I had been looking to make a move over to courier services for our shipping needs when we found Salish. They offered a solution with similar costs to our Canada Post contract but with an efficient and supported service, it was a no brainer to switch over! Gabriel has been a consistent and responsive collaborator. If it weren't for Salish our business would have faired less well during the extended Canada Post strike and beyond. I couldn’t be happier with their service.",
